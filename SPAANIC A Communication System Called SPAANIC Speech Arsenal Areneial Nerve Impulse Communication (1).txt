üéôÔ∏è SPAANIC Codec Overview
SPAANIC is a hybrid neural-linguistic codec designed to encode and decode human communication across seven modalities using a unified impulse-based framework. It translates sensory and expressive data into structured neural signals for transmission, interpretation, and feedback.

üîß Core Architecture
Signal Layer: Converts input from various communication forms into standardized neural impulse packets.

Interpretation Layer: Decodes impulse packets into semantic meaning, emotional tone, and intent.

Feedback Layer: Generates responsive impulses for output across one or more communication forms.

üß† Integrated Communication Forms
SPAANIC supports the following 7 forms of communication, each mapped to a unique impulse signature:

Form of Communication	SPAANIC Encoding Module	Description
1. Verbal	V-SIG	Spoken language encoded via phoneme-to-impulse mapping.
2. Nonverbal	NV-SIG	Gestures, posture, and facial expressions encoded as spatial impulse patterns.
3. Written	W-SIG	Textual input converted to symbolic impulse sequences.
4. Visual	VIS-SIG	Images, symbols, and visual cues encoded as pixel-density impulse arrays.
5. Auditory	AUD-SIG	Non-speech sounds (music, tone, ambient noise) encoded via frequency modulation impulses.
6. Tactile	TAC-SIG	Touch-based signals (pressure, vibration) encoded as haptic impulse bursts.
7. Emotional	EMO-SIG	Affective states encoded via limbic impulse signatures and intensity gradients.
üîÑ Encoding & Decoding Flow
Input Capture: Multimodal sensors detect communication signals.

Impulse Translation: Each signal is translated into its corresponding impulse signature.

Neural Packet Assembly: Impulses are bundled into SPAANIC packets with metadata (form, intensity, context).

Transmission: Packets are sent across neural or digital pathways.

Decoding: Receiver interprets packets using SPAANIC‚Äôs semantic engine.

üß¨ Use Cases
Neural prosthetics for speech and gesture restoration.

AI-human interfaces that interpret emotional and tactile cues.

Multilingual translation across verbal and written forms.

Sensory augmentation for visually or hearing-impaired users.
